# Factory Method

## Explanation

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global
access point to this instance.

Clients may not even realize that theyâ€™re working with the same object all the time.

The Singleton's constructor should be hidden from the client code.
Calling the get_instance method should be the only way of getting the Singleton object.
